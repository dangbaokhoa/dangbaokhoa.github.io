## 👋 Hello there!

Welcome to my personal blog 🎉  
This is the place where I’ll be sharing:

- CTF writeups focused on Web challenges 🕵️
- Practical security research & learning notes 🔐
- Programming tips, experiments and small tools 💻

## 📝 Purpose

I started this blog to:
1. Document my learning process and solutions.
2. Share practical writeups and reusable techniques.
3. Connect with people who are into web security and CTFs.

## 🚀 What’s next?

Expect upcoming posts on:
- Web exploit writeups (XSS, SSRF, Sqli, auth bypass)
- Sandbox bypass tips (Node.js / browser environments)
- Small tooling and automation for recon and exploitation

If you want a particular writeup or topic, drop a note — I’ll prioritize popular requests. 😺
