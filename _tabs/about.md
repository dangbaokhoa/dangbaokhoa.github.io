## About Me

Hi there! I’m a third-year Computer Science student in the Advanced Program in Computer Science (APCS) at Ho Chi Minh City University of Science (HCMUS).

Exploring **web exploitation** and cybersecurity is my passion! Most of my practice happens on DreamHack — you can find me there as [bkshy](https://dreamhack.io/users/75394). I’m also part of the CTF team [Nekopara](https://ctftime.org/team/181613)!
